			<p class="me-p1"> My name is Brendan Thomas Page. I am currently a senior at the University of Tennessee at Martin majoring in Broadcast Communications and minoring in Theatre. The reason I chose Broadcast Communications as my major is because I want to pursue a job in sports broadcasting. Sports have been a major part of my life. Growing up, my family had season tickets to the Tennessee Titans football games. We would go to every home game possible and watch the Titans play live. However, football is not my first sport of choice. That honor belongs to hockey.

			<p class="me-p2">Hockey has quite literally been my life. I was even named after hockey player Brendan Shanahan when he played with the Detroit Red Wings. My love for hockey began in 1998 when the city of Nashville received a hockey team in the NHL, the Nashville Predators. Little did I know that this franchise would be aa major part in my life. Jump forward to 2016. I was fresh out of high school and did not know exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I decided I should voice my love for hockey and become a professional hockey broadcaster. I started searching hard for anything and anyone that could help me. Luckily, I was able to talk to the color commenter for the Nashville Predators Chris Mason. While talking to him, he showed me the ins and outs of hockey television broadcasting, and taught me many of my broadcasting strategies. For radio, however, I was able to get in contact with Mike Lange, play-by-play commentator for the Pittsburgh Penguins. Mike has been calling Penguins games for over 40 years, and was even inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame for his broadcasting skills. Mike and I spent hours talking over the phone, from his early life starting in the broadcast industry, to today where he calls every Penguins game. He has been a mentor in my life, and has helped me become the broadcaster I am today.

			<p class="me-p3">Although my two main sports are hockey and football, I am still able to do commentary for all sports. I have done color commentary for numerous college basketball and baseball games. My knowledge for sports and flexibility in both television and radio broadcasting is why I am a perfect candidate for your team's broadcasting crew.
